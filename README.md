# üìñDESCRIPTION
This project was created as part of my coursework for the Web Development and User Experience module at Birkbeck University. The goal was to design and code a responsive, accessible portfolio website consisting of four pages.
The website demonstrates skills in semantic HTML and responsive CSS, using Grid, Flexbox and Media Queries to create layouts suitable for various screen sizes (laptop, tablet, and mobile).

# üößüë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èPROJECT IMPROVEMENTS:
Future improvements for this project could include implementing a light and dark theme using only HTML, CSS, and the :root pseudo-class to enhance user experience and accessibility. Additionally, I would want to refine the color scheme for better contrast, ensuring greater accessibility for users with visual impairments. Improvements could also foucs on enhancing the quality, scaling, and placement of images to provide a more polished and visually appealing design.
